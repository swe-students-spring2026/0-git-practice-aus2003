# My Opinion

I think that this article is interesting due to its focusing on both the up and downsides of coding with AI. Most articles I read on the internet are either one or the other, and quite strongly so. Additionally, I've also seen a lot of opinions that Product Managers will increasingly not require software engineers - applications like Lovable and Base44 aim to replace them entirely. This article presents the new view that software engineers will not require product managers, and that the two roles will merge. I'm not sure whether the AI will be able to create incredible novel products, but small features could maybe be handled without a product manager.

[When AI writes almost all code, what happens to software engineering?](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/when-ai-writes-almost-all-code-what)

# My Opinion

I think that this article is interesting due to its focusing on both the up and downsides of coding with AI. Most articles I read on the internet are either one or the other, and quite strongly so. Additionally, I've also seen a lot of opinions that Product Managers will increasingly not require software engineers - applications like Lovable and Base44 aim to replace them entirely. This article presents the new view that software engineers will not require product managers, and that the two roles will merge. I'm not sure whether the AI will be able to create incredible novel products, but small features could maybe be handled without a product manager. 

# Comment from Ryan Lu (CHEology)

This article provides an interesting and fairly comprehensive overview of AI's impact on software engineering, required skills, and the job market. Indeed, while some skills (like familiarity with multiple languages) are becoming less important as they can mostly be replaced by AI, understanding code and being able to review and correct any mistakes AI makes is still essential for any developer.

However, even though some functions of software engineers are still essential, the number of engineers required to complete the same task will likely drastically decrease. Whether new demand will emerge is a vital question for software engineers.
